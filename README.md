# advent_of_code
For 2020 I'm trying to learn the rust programming language as I go through the advent of code problems...

Hopefully the quality of the rust code improves over the days.

I don't guarantee that a particular day will be elegant or free from debug statements!

I've also checked in my 2019 code, written in the C programming language, done last year while the puzzles were being posted.
I didn't get all the way through the month.
